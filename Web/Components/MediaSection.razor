            A quick way to create a two-column pattern that shows an image next to a photo. In Bootstrap 4, you gain the ability
            to center elements using flexbox classes. A couple of things to watch out for is that these will always render as
            single columns and can sometimes be too wide, so these particular media elements are inside an eight-column grid.
